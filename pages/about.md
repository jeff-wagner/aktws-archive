## About the Alaska Chapter of The Wildlife Society

[The Wildlife Society](https://www.wildlife.org) is an international nonprofit organization with a mission to “Empower wildlife professionals to advance conservation through science, community, and professional excellence.” Founded in 1937, TWS has since grown into an international network of over 11,000 wildlife professionals.

The Alaska Chapter was founded in 1971 to bring together the expertise of professional wildlife biologists dedicated to excellence in wildlife stewardship in Alaska through science and education. Our Chapter is one of the largest in the country, with over 200 members in state and federal agencies, academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and private industry.

Our mission is to benefit the long-term health of Alaska’s wildlife and the sustained use and enjoyment of these resources by the public we collectively serve. In meeting our mandate, the Alaska Chapter serves as an objective, science-based organization that provides information and thoughtful analysis on important and relevant issues pertaining to conservation of wildlife and their habitats.
